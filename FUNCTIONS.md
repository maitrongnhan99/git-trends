# Project Implementation Plan

## Phase 2: Core Functionality Implementation

### GitHub API Integration

- Create a wrapper for GitHub's GraphQL API to fetch repository analytics
- Implement functions to retrieve repository statistics (stars, forks, commits)
- Use GraphQL for efficient data fetching (as mentioned in the search results)

### Repository Stats Tracker

- Create API routes to fetch and store repository statistics
- Implement backend logic to process and analyze GitHub data
- Set up database models to store historical data for trend analysis

### Trending Repositories Feature

- Build a system to track and display trending GitHub repositories
- Create a scheduled job to periodically fetch trending repositories data
- Store trending repositories in the database for quick access

### User Authentication

- Implement GitHub OAuth for user authentication
- Create user profiles and preferences storage
- Set up secure session management

## Phase 3: Dashboard and UI Development

### Main Dashboard Layout

- Design a responsive dashboard layout using Tailwind CSS
- Create reusable components for repository cards, stats displays, and charts
- Implement a sidebar for navigation between different dashboard views

### Analytics Visualization

- Integrate charting libraries (e.g., Chart.js or D3.js)
- Create visualizations for repository growth metrics
- Implement interactive charts for analyzing stars, forks, and commit trends

### Personalized Dashboard for Starred Repos

- Create a personalized view for tracking user's starred repositories
- Implement a mechanism to fetch and display analytics for starred repos
- Add custom filtering and sorting options

### Responsive Design Implementation

- Ensure the application is fully responsive across all device sizes
- Implement mobile-first design principles using Tailwind CSS utilities
- Create adaptive layouts for different screen sizes

## Phase 4: Advanced Features and Optimization

### Data Caching Strategy

- Implement efficient caching for GitHub API responses
- Use SWR or React Query for client-side data fetching with caching
- Set up server-side caching for frequently accessed data

### Real-time Updates

- Add WebSocket support for real-time dashboard updates
- Implement notifications for significant repository changes
- Create an activity feed showing recent changes to tracked repositories

### Performance Optimization

- Implement code splitting and lazy loading for dashboard components
- Optimize database queries with Prisma
- Set up image optimization with Next.js Image component

## Phase 5: Testing and Deployment

### Testing Implementation

- Write unit tests for API functions and utilities
- Create integration tests for the GitHub API integration
- Implement end-to-end tests for critical user flows

### Deployment Preparation

- Configure environment variables for production
- Set up CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- Prepare database migration scripts

### Production Deployment

- Deploy the Next.js application to Vercel
- Set up a production PostgreSQL database (e.g., Vercel Postgres)
- Configure monitoring and analytics tools
